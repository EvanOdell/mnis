## Introducing mnis_JoinedBetween

`mnis_JoinedBetween` returns a data frame with information on all members who joined the House of Lords, the House of Commons, or both, between two given dates.

As the Members' Names Information Service has dozens of different search parameters and hundreds of possible combinations of searches, it is not reasonable to build functions for every possible query to the API. However, I will be rolling out functions for potentially common queries as and when I can. If you have any particular queries you would like functions for please let me know and I'll create it. 


# mnis 0.1.0

## Introducing the mnis package

This is the first release of the `mnis` package, which provides functions to download data from the Members' Names Information Service for the UK Houses of Parliament.

See the package documentation for details on each function and the type of data available.
